# GenRis
Large genetic diversity and low number of observed clones in population genetic studies of aquatic microalgae create challenges when interpreting the proportion of clones and distinct genotypee in natural algal blooms. This computer model was therefore created to simulate the composition of microalgal populations after a defined period of exponential growth. We simulated the probability of picking clones of the same genotype from this population as a function of initial genotype diversity, intraspecific differences in growth rates and sample size. The number of distinct genotypes in each population can then be extrapolated from the model outputs and observed proportion of clones from respective population genetic studies.



# CurveFitting
Fitting a curve through the mean probabilities of picking clones in a range of population sizes and a set sample size to estimate genotype richness based on an observed proportion of clones.
