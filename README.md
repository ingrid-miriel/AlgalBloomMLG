# GenRis
Large genetic diversity and low number of observed identical multi-locus genotypes (MLG) in population genetic studies of aquatic microalgae create challenges when interpreting the proportion of MLGs in natural algal blooms. This computer model was therefore created to simulate the composition of microalgal populations after a defined period of exponential growth. We simulated the probability of picking identical MLGs from this population as a function of initial genotypic diversity, intraspecific differences in growth rates and sample size. The number of distinct genotypes in each population can then be extrapolated from the model outputs and observed proportion of identical MLGs in respective population genetic studies. 



# CurveFitting
Fitting a curve through the mean probabilities of picking identical MLGs in a range of population sizes and a set sample size to estimate genotypic richness based on an observed proportion of identical MLGs.
